Currently, I do not have a specific purpose for this website. That may change.

This website is hosted on [Github Pages](https://github.com/) using Amazon's [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) for a custom domain name.

The website is built via [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and is a customized version of the [Alembic](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic) theme.
