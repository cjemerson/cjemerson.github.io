**Hello and welcome!** This is the very first post on my brand new website. I am not someone who uses social media, blogs or social apps, so creating a public persona is new to me.

<!--more-->

The purpose of this endeavor is simple: Force myself to work on something new. I find myself becoming stagnant if I do not find something new to fascinate me. This lethargy boils over into activities I regularly enjoy which means it is a self-destructive cycle.

This is a new start, a new experience, and a new project. I do not know how I far I will go with this. My intention is to expand my knowledge and experience so I can teach other people to create and use a similar website setup.

At the very least, I plan to have fun while working on this website. A fun project that I can play with in all sorts of silly ways.
